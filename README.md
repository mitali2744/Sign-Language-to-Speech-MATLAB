# 🧠 Sign Language to Speech Conversion using MATLAB

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a real-time **Sign Language to Speech Conversion System** developed using MATLAB. The system recognizes hand gestures from images and converts them into text and speech output.

The primary goal of this project is to bridge the communication gap between hearing-impaired individuals and non-sign language users by enabling seamless and inclusive communication.

## ⚙ System Workflow
1. Capture hand gesture image.
2. Perform preprocessing (grayscale conversion, resizing, normalization).
3. Extract relevant image features.
4. Classify the gesture using a trained model.
5. Convert predicted gesture into text.
6. Generate speech output.

## 📊 Results
- Achieved accurate gesture recognition under proper lighting conditions.
- Successfully converted recognized gestures into text and speech.
- Demonstrated real-time performance.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Continuous sentence recognition instead of single gestures.
- Multi-language speech output support.
- Mobile application integration.
- Deployment on embedded systems for portable usage.
